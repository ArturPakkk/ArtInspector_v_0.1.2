# ArtInspector provenance status

Audit date: 2026-09-22. This document records evidence, not an assertion that all
unattributed work belongs to ArtInspector. No private prompts or conversations
are published as provenance evidence.

Ultimate origin/authorship of UI icons and the logo has not been conclusively established. No third-party license is assigned without file-level evidence. MANUAL REVIEW REQUIRED.

Current shader files match the public main snapshot and the associated current
legacy source byte-for-byte. Internal history traces material integration; it
does not prove that the original algorithms or code were independently authored.
Solid Wireframe also has an earlier implementation guide describing its native
barycentric integration. Neither that guide nor the commit author establishes
an upstream copyright license by itself. No supplied external attribution was
found in the checked material comments.

No packaged Adobe/React/Unreal icon library was found in the build. This does
not rule out copied coordinates. Searches in available local SVG/HTML material
found the matching project logo, but no definitive original third-party source.
The exact historical HTML reference has not been recovered.

No third-party license or original ArtInspector authorship is assigned to unknown icons or the logo without file-level evidence.

Resolution: record the exact upstream repository, package, file/version and applicable LICENSE,
NOTICE and modification requirements, or commission/implement a clearly recorded
replacement in a separate authorized task. No rendering, checker or icon changes
were made merely to close this audit.
